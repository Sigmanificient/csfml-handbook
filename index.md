*CSFML - Simple and Fast Multimedia Library binding for C*

:::{note}
This website does not serve as the unofficial CSFML documentation.
:::

A crafted guide for mastering CSFML graphics programming.
This handbook includes tutorials and a detailed API reference.

> CSFML is the official binding of SFML for the C language.
> Its API is as close as possible to the C++ API (but in C style, of course),
> which makes it a perfect tool for building SFML bindings for other languages
> that don't directly support C++ libraries.
